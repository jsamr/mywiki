## VOCABULARY

**Virtual Terminal :** Console sessions that use the entire display and keyboard outside of a graphical environment
**X Window System :** Graphical interface (low level) used in linux. X for Xorg
**Dangling link :** Symbolic link pointing to a non-existing file or folder
**SPOOL :** Simultaneous Peripheral Operations On-line. Buffering used to communcate at peripheral's rate, avoiding the slowing of the system.

## ADMINISTRATION

### Sudoers

All set up in `/etc/sudoers` and `/etc/sudoers.d/`
The command to edit privileges is `visudo`.
while `su` prompts to login as root, `sudo` prompts for root privileges.
The syntax is following :

`username ALL=(ALL) ALL`

The file must have permissions set to 440.

### User information

All stored in `/etc/passwd`, with 7 fields :
* username
* password (or x if encrypted in `/etc/shadow`)
* UserID (0 is root, 1-99 are predifined accounts, 100-999 reserved for system accounts and groups)
* GroupID (stored in `/etc/group`)
* User Info (optional, user name)
* Home directory
* Shell (bin absolute path)

`/etc/shadow` contains the SHA-512 encrypted password...
`chage` allows to set expire dates to passwords.
The PAM module can enforce high complexity passwords.
A password prompt can be configured for the boot loader (GRUB2)

### Accounts types

#### root

Authentified through `su`
The most privileged account.
Can :
* add accounts
* change user passwords
* examinate log files
* install packages
* edit system files
* manage system services
* manage groups

Extra care must be taken.

#### system

#### normal

Can :
* Run a network client
* use devices such as printers
* operate on files on which user has permissions
* run **SUID-root applications** like with `sudo`

SUID stands for Set owner User ID. It provides temporary permissions to a user to run aprogram with the permissions of the file owner.

#### network

## FILE PRIVILEGES

### Codes

1 : x
2 : w
4 : r

### Tools

`chown` change file/dir ownership
`chgrp` change file/dir group affiliation(s)
`chmod` change file/dir permissions

## NOTEWORTHY CONFIG FILES

`/etc/apt/sources.list` List of apt packages servers
`/etc/default/grub` Grub config file (needs grub-updates for changes to take effect)
`/etc/fstab` Startup mount devices description
